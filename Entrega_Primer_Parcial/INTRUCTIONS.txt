############### WELCOME!!!!! #################

INSTRUCTIONS:

PREREQUISITES: 
	- HAVE A TEXT EDITOR INSTALLED
	- HAVE GFORTRAN INSTALLED 
		*http://www.lapk.org/gfortran/gfortran.php?OS=7
		*https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries
	- PREFERABLY HAVE A UNIX BASED TERMINAL

1.- IN ORDER TO LOAD A FUNCTION INTO THE PROGRAM YOU NEED TO OPEN THE 
'first_partial.f90' FILE WITH THE TEXT EDITOR OF YOUR CHOICE.
(NOTE: THE PROGRAM COMES PRELODED WITH A FUNCTION)

2.- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PROGRAM YOU WILL FIND TWO FUNCTIONS CALLED
'f' and 'f_prime'. THEY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

	DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION f(x)
	  IMPLICIT NONE
	  DOUBLE PRECISION :: x
	  f =  <---------------------- YOUR FUNCTION GOES HERE
	END FUNCTION f

	DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION f_prime(x)
	  IMPLICIT NONE
	  DOUBLE PRECISION :: x
	  f_prime = <------------------ THE DERIVATIVE OF YOUR FUNCTION GOES HERE
	END FUNCTION f_prime

3.- AFTER YOU INPUT YOUR FUNCTION AND THE DERIVATIVE OF YOUR FUNCTION, SAVE THE FILE AND EXIT YOUR TEXT EDITOR.

4.- THEN, OPEN YOUR TERMINAL AND NAVIGATE TO THE DIRECTORY IN WHICH THE PROGRAMS ARE LOCATED

5.- IN YOUR TERMINAL TYPE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS (omit the '$')
	$gfortran -o first_partial first_partial.f90

	#THIS COMMAND WILL COMPILE THE FILE AND CREATE ANOTHER ONE YOU CAN
	EXECUTE

	$./first_partial

	#THIS COMMAND WILL EXECUTE THE PROGRAM.


### INSIDE THE PROGRAM #####

*INSIDE THE PROGRAM YOU WILL HAVE A MENU WHERE YOU CAN SELECT THE DESIRED
METHOD TO FIND THE ROOT OF THE FUNCTION. IT WILL LOOK SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS:

 WELCOME!
 WHAT METHOD DO YOU WANT TO USE [TYPE THE NUMBER OF THE DESIRED METHOD]
 1) BISECTION
 2) FALSE POSITION
 3) NEWTON RAPHSON
 4) SECANT


*THEN, YOU TYPE THE NUMBER OF THE METHOD YOU WANT TO CHOOSE AND CLICK ENTER
(IN THIS EXAMPLE WE WILL USE BISECTION AND THE FUNCTION 5 + 2*x - 3*(x**2) + 4*(x**3))


*THE PROGRAM THEN WILL ASK FOR THE NECESSESARY DATA TO RUN THE METHOD OF 
CHOICE, AS WELL AS THE TOLERANCE, NUMBER OF ITERS. IT WILL LOOK A BIT LIKE
THIS:

	 #################### FALSE POSITION METHOD ####################
 Lower bound of the interval:
-2
 Upper bound of the interval:
0
  -43.000000000000000     
   5.0000000000000000     
 Perfect!
 Input the tolerance
0.001
 Input the number of iterations
50
 The result is:  -0.75928280261679293     
 Iters:   19.0000000    

*AT THE END IT WILL ASK IF YOU WANT TO TRY ANOTHER METHOD
	DO YOU WANT TO TRY ANOTHER METHOD ? [Y/N]

*IF YOU INPUT 'Y' IT WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MENU, IF YOU INPUT 'N' THE PROGRAM WILL CLOSE.
